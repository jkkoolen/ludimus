# ludimus

This is a project of my own for my own. I use this for my bookkeeping.
Track revenue and expense, create custom reports for doing my taxes.
Export my invoices and receipts to a pdf to hand it over to my taxman.

I also use this project to try new frameworks, and languages,
Using spring jpa, spring securiry, spring mvc, spring ws, flyway.

Because my interest in scala i am using this project for converting java to scala in bits and pieces.

For running this app, you need a mysql database calles ludimus (defined with properties which can be found in LudimusDomainConfig.java)
